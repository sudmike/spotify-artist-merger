Design/Functionality Backlog:
V1
- input of artists [Angular Spotify API, fetching correct Artistname]
- artist table [artists as objects]
- remove artist from table
- custom playlist names
- songs per artist, default based on number of artists
- error warnings for events like duplicate artist or empty artist field [custom warnings from backend to frontend]
- pics of artists in table [fetch along with name, turn 'artist' into Object (?)]
-> create Playlist [handover to backend]

V2
idea: management of already created Playlists
- table of all playlists created with App [Based on Playlist Description]
 - rename playlist
 - toggle private/public
 - delete if possible
 - refresh playlist
 - refresh all
- edit single playlist
 - remove/add artists
 - change number of songs for an artist
 - similar to playlist creation in V1

V3
idea: temporary playlists that get removed after a day/week/month and automatic refreshs of playlists
